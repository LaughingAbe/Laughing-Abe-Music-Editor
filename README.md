A fun way to write music for colour coded ukulele. 

Hello my name is Abraham van den Berg aka Laughing Abe, the ukulele teacher from Cape Town, South Africa.
I've created a new way of learning music on the ukulele using colour coded sticker on my ukuleles and corresponding symbols 
that is easy for children to understand. 

Check out my Ted-talk about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_foJ2T0Bhog

I'd like to expand and improve this application by extending it's capabilities and to enable more people to use it to create 
their own colour coded song and music resourese.
